        Radha Krishna's first literary mention was found in King Hala's Prakrit text Gatha Saptasati which is composed
        of 700 verses and was written in the 1st century CE.[15][16][17] Later, The popular Gita Govinda written by
        Jayadeva in 12th century CE widely depicted Radha and Krishna as a couple.[18][19][20] According to scriptures
        like Brahma Vaivarta Purana and Garga Samhita, Radha-Krishna are the supreme deities. Content of both the
        scriptures are majorly based on the divine pastimes of Radha Krishna in Vrindavan and Goloka. The other relevant
        texts mentioning Radha Krishna are the Radhopnishad of Rig Veda, Radhatapani Upanishad of Atharva Veda, Shiva
        Purana, Brahmanda Purana, Skanda Purana, Padma Purana, Matsya Purana, Devi-Bhagavata Purana, Narada Pancharatra
        and Brahma samhita. Goddess Radha is also indirectly mentioned in Bhagavata Purana of Sukadeva Goswami along
        with Lord Krishna under many different names like "Aradhika" and "Gopi".[21] Adi Shankracharya who happened way
        before Jayadeva also mentioned Goddess Radha in his work called "Achyuta Ashtakam" which is dedicated to Achyuta
        form of Lord Krishna.

        The devotional works of Jayadeva, Nimbarkacharya, Rasik saints like Chaitanya Mahaprabhu along with his six
        disciple goswamis, Bhakti poet-saints Narsinh Mehta, Vidyapati, Chandidas, Meera Bai, Surdas, Swami Haridas and
        many more played pivotal role in enlighting society about goddess Radha who is believed to be the feminine form
        of Krishna himself.[22] According to several Hindu denominations including Gaudiya Vaishnavism, Nimbarka
        Sampradaya, Pushtimarg, and Swaminarayan Sampradaya, it is believed that Radha is not just one cowherd maiden,
        but the origin of all the gopis, or divine personalities that participate in the rasa dance.[23] They are also
        mentioned in Gopala Tapani Upanishad, Chaitanya Charitamrita and Gita Govinda.[citation needed]

        Shakti and Shaktiman

        The common derivation of shakti and shaktiman, i.e. female and male principle in a god implies that shakti and
        shaktiman are the same.[24] Each and every god has its partner, or Shakti, and without this Shakti, is sometimes
        viewed being without essential power.[25] It is a not uncommon feature of Hinduism when worship of a pair rather
        than one personality constitutes worship of God, such is worship of Radha Krishna. Traditions worshiping
        Krishna, as svayam bhagavan, who is male, include reference and veneration to his Radha, who is worshiped as
        supreme. A view that exists of orthodox Krishnaism, the sect of the worship of Krishna, is that Radha is shakti
        and Krishna is shaktiman and are always found without any tinge of materialistic attributes or cause.[26]

        Theology and philosophy

        Jayadeva worshipping of Radha Krishna.
        From the Vaishnava point of view the divine feminine energy (shakti) implies a divine source of energy, God or
        shaktiman. "Sita relates to Rama; Lakshmi belongs to Narayana; Radha has her Krishna." As Krishna is believed to
        be the source of all manifestations of God, "Radha, his consort, is the original source of all shaktis" or
        feminine manifestation of divine energy.[27]

        The first theologo-philosophical justification for worshiping Radha-Krishna was given by Nimbarkacharya, a
        founder of the Nimbarka Sampradaya in 12th or 13th century CE.[17] In accordance with the Sahitya Akademi
        Encyclopaedia, he more than any other acharyas gave Radha a place as a deity.[28]
